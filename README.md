# CovidData Native iOS Mobile App

This is the mobile app that I made back then by using Swift and Xcode for my University's iOS course term project.

It takes covid data from a json file, parse the data and presented inside a custom tableView. It also includes:

- CoreData
- Gestures
- MVC
- An external library
